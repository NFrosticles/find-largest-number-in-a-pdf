PDF Number Extractor

Overview

This Python script extracts and identifies the largest number from a PDF document using natural language processing and regular expressions. It performs two key tasks:

1) Finds the largest number while considering natural language scaling (e.g., "5 million" â†’ 5,000,000).

2) Finds the largest raw numerical value without considering context (e.g., "9999" is greater than "5 million").
